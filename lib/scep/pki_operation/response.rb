  module PKIOperation

    # Represents a SCEP response from the PKIOperation, which can do two of the following:
    #
    # * Parse a response form another SCEP server (useful for proxying)
    # * Create our own SCEP response
    #
    # @example Get Certificates Ready
    #   ra_cert = SCEP::DEFAULT_RA_CERTIFICATE
    #   ra_key  = SCEP::DEFAULT_RA_PRIVATE_KEY
